# Game of Life 

This program uses NumPy and Matplotlib libraries, it's an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, which are either alive or dead.

# How to use
1. Install the required dependencies: pip install numpy matplotlib

2. Run the simulation: python game_of_life.py or python3 depending on your version

You can customize the simulation by modifying the following parameters:

- Width: Set the desired width of the grid.
- Height: Set the desired height of the grid.
- Randomize Initial State: Choose whether to randomize the initial state or provide a custom pattern.
- Custom Initial State: If not randomizing, enter the initial state row by row using 'X' for alive cells and '-' for dead cells.

# Dependencies
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations and animations.
